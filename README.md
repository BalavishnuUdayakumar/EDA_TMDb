Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset

Dataset:
This data set (tmdb-movies.csv) contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 

Aim:
Here, I have tried to conduct a preliminary investigation of the TMDb movie data and answer two questions through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Questions:
Q1. Which are the three most and least popular genres of each decade ?
Q2. What characteristics distinguish the top 10% profitable movies (all time) from the bottom 10% ?
